      <h2>About Director:- Ryan Kyle Coogler</h2>

      <p>Ryan Kyle Coogler (born May 23, 1986) is an American film director, producer, and screenwriter. His first<br>
         feature film, Fruitvale Station (2013), won the top audience and grand jury awards in the U.S. dramatic competition<br>
          at the 2013 Sundance Film Festival. He has since co-written and directed the seventh film in the Rocky series,<br>
           Creed (2015), and the Marvel film Black Panther (2018), the latter of which broke numerous box office records and<br> 
           became the highest-grossing film of all time by an African American director.<br>
        Coogler's films have received significant critical acclaim and commercial success. In 2013, he was included on Time's<br>
         list of the 30 people under 30 who are changing the world. His work has been hailed by critics for centering on often <br>
         overlooked cultures and characters—most notably African Americans. He frequently collaborates with actor Michael B. Jordan,<br>
          who appeared in his first three feature films, as well as composer Ludwig Göransson, who has scored four of his films.<br>
        In 2018, Coogler was named the runner-up of Time's Person of the Year and he was included in the annual Time 100 list of <br>
        the most influential people in the world.<br> </p>

                    <h3 class="question">IS KILLMONGER REALLY DEAD?</h3>
                    <span>+</span>
                    <div class="answer">
                      <p>Two words: Kimoyo beads. Agent Ross would be dead had T'Challa not stabilized him with the Wakandan tech following that fatal shoot-out with Klaue's motley crew of criminals. T'Challa had contemplated doing the same for Killmonger until the latter proclaimed that he'd rather choose death over bondage, removed the spear from his chest, and seemingly bled out on the ground as the camera cut to a cinematic wide shot. We see T'Challa fold Killmonger's hands on his chest — and that's it. Could he have slipped a Kimoyo bead into the wound? Or did he adhere to his cousin's final wishes?</p>
                      <p>So even though Shuri — and the Marvel Powers That Be — could bring Killmonger back from the dead, it would ultimately undermine Coogler's carefully crafted story. As much as we love Michael B. Jordan, this king is dead.</p>

                    <h3 class="question">WHAT ABOUT MALICE?</h3>
                    <span>+</span>
                    <div class="answer">
                      <p>In the comics, Nakia takes a villainous turn as Malice. Though she was originally part of the Dora Milaje, her unrequited infatuation with T'Challa nearly turned deadly and resulted in her banishment from Wakanda. Obviously, Lupita Nyong'o's Nakia is a very different version of the character — though, she's just as strong-willed. But that doesn't mean Malice won't rear her jealous head at some point. Nakia is loyal to her king, but if his loyalty to her is compromised somehow — possibly by the introduction of the X-Men mutant Storm, T'Challa's wife in the comics — then maybe that would be enough to turn her to the dark side.</p>

                    <h3 class="question">SO WHAT BRINGS THANOS'S ARMY TO WAKANDA IN AVENGERS: INFINITY WAR?</h3>
                    <span>+</span>
                    <div class="answer">
                      <p>Either Thanos is on the hunt for that Soul Stone, or he wants his hands on Wakanda's Vibranium — a.k.a the strongest metal in the world. In the mid-credits scene, T'Challa goes public with Wakanda's most precious resource at the United Nations. As a result, Wakanda is now vulnerable to outside attacks. Perhaps Thanos sees the Vibranium-rich country as his only major threat and therefore he sends the Black Order to destroy it. Or maybe the Vibranium is the key to the Soul Stone. If Vibranium powers Wakanda and gives it life, then the Soul Stone could be powering the Vibranium. What if the thing that makes Vibranium so powerful is the Infinity Stone? Either way, Nakia better hope that she was right when she said, "Wakanda is strong enough to help others and protect itself at the same time."</p>
