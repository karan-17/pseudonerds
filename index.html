      <h2>About Director:- Ryan Kyle Coogler</h2>

      <p>Ryan Kyle Coogler (born May 23, 1986) is an American film director, producer, and screenwriter. His first<br>
         feature film, Fruitvale Station (2013), won the top audience and grand jury awards in the U.S. dramatic competition<br>
          at the 2013 Sundance Film Festival. He has since co-written and directed the seventh film in the Rocky series,<br>
           Creed (2015), and the Marvel film Black Panther (2018), the latter of which broke numerous box office records and<br> 
           became the highest-grossing film of all time by an African American director.<br>
        Coogler's films have received significant critical acclaim and commercial success. In 2013, he was included on Time's<br>
         list of the 30 people under 30 who are changing the world. His work has been hailed by critics for centering on often <br>
         overlooked cultures and characters—most notably African Americans. He frequently collaborates with actor Michael B. Jordan,<br>
          who appeared in his first three feature films, as well as composer Ludwig Göransson, who has scored four of his films.<br>
        In 2018, Coogler was named the runner-up of Time's Person of the Year and he was included in the annual Time 100 list of <br>
        the most influential people in the world.<br> </p>

          <p>After the death of his father, T'Challa returns home to the African nation of Wakanda to take his rightful place as king. When a powerful enemy suddenly reappears, T'Challa's mettle as king -- and as Black Panther -- gets tested when he's drawn into a conflict that puts the fate of Wakanda and the entire world at risk. Faced with treachery and danger, the young king must rally his allies and release the full power of Black Panther to defeat his foes and secure the safety of his people.
