<FONT FACE="FRANKLIN GOTHIC" COLOR="WHITE" SIZE="3"> <H3 ALIGN="LEFT">Centuries ago, as five African tribes war over a meteorite made up of the alien metal 
vibranium,<br> a warrior shaman Bashenga ingests a Heart-Shaped Herb affected by the metal and gains superhuman abilities. <BR>
Becoming the first "Black Panther", he unites all tribes except the Jabari tribe, and forms the nation of Wakanda. As time <BR>
 passes, the Wakandans use the vibranium to develop highly-advanced technology while simultaneously isolating themselves from
 the rest of the world and posing as a third world country.
In 1992, King T'Chaka visits his brother N'Jobu, who is working undercover in Oakland,
 California. T'Chaka accuses N'Jobu of assisting black-market arms dealer Ulysses Klaue 
 in stealing vibranium from Wakanda. N'Jobu's partner reveals he is Zuri, another undercover Wakandan, and confirms T'Chaka's suspicions.<br></H3>

 following T'Chaka's death at the hands of Helmut Zemo, after working with Okoye, the leader of the 
 Dora Milaje, to extract his ex-lover Nakia from an undercover assignment in Nigeria's Sambisa Forest, he 
 reunites with his mother, Queen Ramonda, and sister, Princess Shuri.</H3>
 <font face="FRANKLIN GOTHIC" COLOR="WHITE" SIZE="3"><H3 ALIGN="RIGHT">Later at the ceremony, to formally induct him as the king, T'Challa drinks 
 a liquid that removes his enhanced strength and formally invites anyone to challenge his claim as king in ritual combat. The challenger to step
 forward is M'Baku, the leader of the mountain-dwelling Jabari Tribe, who claims that T'Challa is not worthy of being king. The two engage in ritual 
 combat, and even without his strength, T'Challa manages to best him and spares his life. T'Challa is crowned the new King and drinks a fluid derived
 from the heart-shaped herb. As his body digests the herb T'Challa goes into a deep sleep where he visits the Ancestral Plane and reunites with a vision
 of his father who advises him he is a good man but also warns him that he has hard times ahead and should surround himself with people he trusts. With
 this T'Challa wakes up from his dream.</H3>

 Museum of Great Britain. When Wakanda hears of Klaue's actions, T'Challa's friend and Okoye's lover W'Kabi, who lost his parents as a result of the dealer's
 actions, urges the young monarch to bring him to justice. T'Challa, Okoye, and Nakia plan to intercept Klaue at an underground casino in Busan, where he will
 be selling a stolen artifact to an unknown buyer. The plan, however, goes wrong when T'Challa discovers the buyer is CIA agent Everett Ross. As a result, the
 Dora Milaje are forced to sabotage the</H3>

 <FONT FACE="FRANKLIN GOTHIC" COLOR="WHITE" SIZE="3"><H3 ALIGN="RIGHT"><H3>Meanwhile, Killmonger kills Klaue and takes his body to Wakanda, revealing his identity 
 before the tribal elders and challenging T'Challa for the throne in ritual combat. Deciding Killmonger has a legitimate claim, the ritual combat begins with 
While Shuri, Nakia, and Okoye join the Dora Milaje and Jabari in battling W'Kabi and the Wakandan army, Ross, piloting a remote jet, shoots down the planes carrying
 the weapons before they can leave the country. Confronted by Okoye, W'Kabi and his army stand down. Killmonger overpowers the Dora Milaje and comes close to 
 murdering Shuri, but T'Challa saves her and tackles Killmonger into the Great Mound. M'Baku and the Jabari arrive, and they defeat W'Kabi, forcing the Border 
 Tribe to surrender.
While T'Challa and Killmonger vie for supremacy, sonic disruptors used in the transport of the metal in the mine incapacitate their vibranium armors. T'Challa
 uses this to his advantage, and overpowers Killmonger, impaling him with a dagger. T'Challa, victorious, shows mercy to Killmonger and fulfills his childhood 
 wish to witness the sunset of Wakanda. Killmonger refuses T'Challa's offer to be healed and pulls the dagger out of his chest, choosing to die a free man rather
 than be incarcerated.
Rejecting the isolationism of past Wakandan kings, T'Challa establishes an embassy in Oakland, California, purchasing the apartment complex where N'Jobu was 
murdered. T'Challa appoints Shuri and Nakia to run the embassy. Soon after, T'Challa appears before the United Nations in the rebuilt Vienna International Centre
 to reveal Wakanda's resources to the world, and to come out of isolation. Later, Bucky Barnes who was granted asylum by T'Challa wakes up in Wakanda, and is met
 by Shuri, who begins to help him with his recuperation from his mental programming.</H3>
